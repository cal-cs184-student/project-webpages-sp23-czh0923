                Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image.
            </b></p>
        <p>
            When max_ray_depth = 0, since there's no bouncing of light, we're only seeing the light source. 
            When max_ray_depth = 1, we start to see direct illumination, as we allow one bounce of light. 
            When max_ray_depth = 2, since the left sphere is mirror, a ray can bounce twice and hit the mirror eventually, so we can see reflected light on the mirror surface. 
            The right sphere is still dark because it's glass, and some rays are still trapped inside the glass within 2 bounces so they can't pass through the glass. 
            When max_ray_depth = 3, the left sphere now has the reflection of the wall, and since we are not allowed 3 bounces, a lot more rays can pass through the glass 
            material, so the rendering of the glass ball is more realistic now. 
            When max_ray_depth = 4, the left sphere now has a realistic reflection of the right sphere, as we're now allowed one more bouncing of rays, so the rays that come out of
            the right sphere can bounce on the surface of the left sphere again. 
            When max_ray_depth = 5, overall not much difference from the previous depth, but the scene is brighter
            When max_ray_depth = 100, the scene became very bright due to the amount of bouncing that we're allowing. 
        </p>

                Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all
