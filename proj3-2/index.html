        <p>
            When max_ray_depth = 0, since there's no bouncing of light, we're only seeing the light source. 
            When max_ray_depth = 1, we start to see direct illumination, as we allow one bounce of light. 
            When max_ray_depth = 2, since the left sphere is mirror, a ray can bounce twice and hit the mirror eventually, so we can see reflected light on the mirror surface. 
            The right sphere is still dark because it's glass, and some rays are still trapped inside the glass within 2 bounces so they can't pass through the glass. 
            When max_ray_depth = 3, the left sphere now has the reflection of the wall, and since we are not allowed 3 bounces, a lot more rays can pass through the glass 
            material, so the rendering of the glass ball is more realistic now. 
            When max_ray_depth = 4, the left sphere now has a realistic reflection of the right sphere, as we're now allowed one more bouncing of rays, so the rays that come out of
            the right sphere can bounce on the surface of the left sphere again. 
            When max_ray_depth = 5, overall not much difference from the previous depth, but the scene is brighter
            When max_ray_depth = 100, the scene became very bright due to the amount of bouncing that we're allowing.

            </b></p> -->
        <p>
            In pinhole camera model, we assume that light travels in straight line from each point on an object to a single point on the image plane through a small aperture or pinhole. 
            This model does not account for lens distortion or the effects of refraction, and all pixels are in focused. 
            <br>
            
            On the other hand, the thin-lens camera model assumes that light from a point on an object passes through a thin lens and forms an image on the opposite side of the lens. 
            This model more accurately captures what happens in reality when we capture images with cameras or see scenes with our eyes. 
            Only objects with distance from camera equals the focal distance are clear while all other objects are blurred. 
            This model accounts for lens distortion and refraction effects, but assumes that the lens is thin and that light passes through the center of the lens.
